This is the R-code used to create a website where the user inputs in values, and outputs results. This was designed using R-Shiny.\
The calculator is based on the works of Al Labadi, L., Evans, M. and Liang, Q. (2022).\
The paper is found here: https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/12/1710\
It is fortunately open access! :)
